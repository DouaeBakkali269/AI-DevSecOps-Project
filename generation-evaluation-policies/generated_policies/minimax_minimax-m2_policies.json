Vulnerability information must be obtained from multiple sources including security advisories, vendor notifications, and automated scanning (SAST, SCA, DAST). All systems and applications must be regularly assessed for vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools. Identified vulnerabilities must be classified according to risk level considering exploitability, business impact, and exposure. Remediation must be prioritized based on risk assessment results. Emergency patches must be applied within defined timeframes for critical vulnerabilities. A remediation tracking system must monitor progress and escalate overdue items. Post-remediation testing must verify successful mitigation without introducing new issues. Third-party dependencies must be continuously monitored and updated to non-vulnerable versions. Exceptions require documented risk acceptance and compensating controls.",
